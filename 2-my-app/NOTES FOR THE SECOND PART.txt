3-Linking : using <Link> Component 

4-useRouter: (hook) it has many methods we can use ( push , back , forward , refresh .. etc ) 
 - it works with function too : <button onClick={() => router.push("/userouter")}> PAGE </button> ( programmatic navigation )

5-Private Pages: just add _ before the name of the folder (_products) then you can't navigate to it

6- Route Groups: 
   - (auth)
     - login
     - register 
 - if we want to navigate to login directly (/login) we need to add (auth) as name of folder but if we
 - try for exemple (/auth/login) will not work 

7-Dynamic Routes: need to be asynchronous to get parameters from the route then use it 
  - games
   - [gameId]
     - pages.tsx
   - page.tsx
